    "### Reinforcement Learning in Pacman\n",
    "Reinforcement learning (RL) is a branch of machine learning in which an agent learns to performs actions in an environment in order to maximize a cumulative reward <a name=\"suttonnote\"></a>[<sup>[4]</sup>](#sutton&barto). The agent iteratively explores the environment, observing the outcomes, rewards and penalties, of its actions. Over time, it refines a policy, which specifies the actions to take in each state to optimize long term return. Early RL methods, such as Q-learning and SARSA, rely on tabular representations of the value function Q(s,a) to estimate how desirable each action a is in a given state s. These approaches are effective in smaller domans, but become less reliable as the state space grows. This limitation has led to the integration of deep learning, more specifically Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)<a name=\"Arulkumarannote\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#arulkamaran). DRL leverages neural networks to approximate the value function or policy, allowing the agent to handle high-dimesional states <a name=\"mnihnote\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#mnih).\n",
    "\n",
    "Pac-Man is a classic arcade game featuring a grid-based maze. The agent (Pac-Man) navigates the maze to collect pellets while avoiding or chasing four ghosts. This environment offers RL challenges:\n",
    "- Discrete Action Space: Pac-Man can move in five different directions (up, down, left, right, stay)\n",
    "- Reward Structure: The game provides immediate rewards (pellets), high-value rewards (power pellets), and strong penalties (losing a life).\n",
    "- Adversial Dynamics: Ghosts actively pursue Pac-Man\n",
    "Because of these properties, Pac-Man is an ideal environment setup for RL. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Prior Work\n",
    "\n",
    "Pac-Man has been a popular benchmark for artificial intelligence (AI) research since the 1980s, initially explored through rule-based or search-based methods (e.g., depth-first search and A*) and later through classical reinforcement learning (RL). Early RL applications often employed tabular Q-learning on simplified mazes, where state representations included Pac-Man’s coordinates, ghost positions, and pellet locations. However, this approach suffered from a combinatorial explosion in larger or more complex layouts. To reduce the dimensionality, some researchers employed hand-engineered features—like “ghost proximity” or “pellet distance”—rather than storing value estimates for every possible state. Around the same time, Ms. Pac-Man emerged as a competition environment <a name=\"lucasnote\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#lucas), prompting novel strategies such as neuroevolution and hybrid RL techniques, which further demonstrated the need for more scalable, generalizable methods\n",
    "\n",
    "As deep learning gained traction, Deep Q-Networks (DQN) were introduced, showing human-level control in various Atari games <a name=\"mnihnote\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#mnih). This success naturally extended to Pac-Man, where deep RL agents learned to approximate Q-values using convolutional neural networks, bypassing manual feature engineering. The advent of DQN variants like Double DQN, Prioritized Experience Replay, and policy-gradient methods further improved stability and performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "Pac-Man is simpler than real-world environments, but still offers many challenges:\n",
    "- Exponential State Space: The number of possible states grows quickly with the maze size, the postions of Pac-Man, number of ghosts, and remaining pellets.\n",
    "- Sparse Rewards: Collecting pellets is straightforward, but learning optimal strategies like chasing ghosts with higher power-pellet rewards can be challenging.\n",
    "- Exploration vs Exploitation: Pac-Man may be drawn to safer paths, but effective policies sometimes require risk taking like high-value power pellets.\n",
    "- Computational Cost: DRL can be computationally expensive, which will require careful hyperparameter tuning and potentially large-scale training to converge to optimal solutions <a name=\"Arulkumarannote\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#arulkamaran)"

    "Our project mainly focuses on developing and comparing AI's with different machine learning algorithms, but there are some ethical consequences we must consider. One concern is that the AI agent may develop exploitative strategies if they were to find a loophold in the reward system, they might try to stall and play as safe as possible instead of finding the best way to get a high score, or manipulate game mechanics and bug out the game. We will adjust the reward system and take the game's bugs into consideration when creating our machine learning models to mitigate these issues.\n",
